This repository contains a minimal reproducible example of a bug encountered while using nested routes in React Router Dom v6. The bug manifests as nested routes not rendering correctly despite being properly defined. The solution demonstrates how to resolve this issue by using the correct nesting structure and ensuring that the parent routes are rendered correctly.  The solution was tested using React 18 and React Router Dom v6.  Pull requests are welcome!
